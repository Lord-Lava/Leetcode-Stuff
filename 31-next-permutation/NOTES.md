According to Wikipedia, a man named Narayana Pandita presented the following simple algorithm to solve this problem in the 14th century.
​
Find the largest index k such that nums[k] < nums[k + 1]. If no such index exists, just reverse nums and done.
Find the largest index l > k such that nums[k] < nums[l].
Swap nums[k] and nums[l].
Reverse the sub-array nums[k + 1:].
